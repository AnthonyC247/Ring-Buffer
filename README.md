# RingBuffer

The `RingBuffer` class is an implementation of a circular buffer or ring buffer data structure in Python. It provides a fixed-size buffer with efficient enqueuing and dequeuing operations while utilizing memory efficiently. This README aims to explain the purpose of the code and the data structures and algorithms employed.

## Purpose

The purpose of this code is to implement a circular buffer, also known as a ring buffer, which is a data structure that allows for the efficient management of a fixed-size buffer. The key advantage of a ring buffer is that it reuses memory by overwriting the oldest elements when new elements are enqueued. This makes it ideal for scenarios where you want to keep track of a limited history of elements or manage a rotating set of data.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

### Circular Buffer

A circular buffer is implemented using a list to store elements, with pointers to track the head (front) and tail (rear) positions within the buffer. These pointers wrap around using modulo arithmetic to maintain the circular behavior. This ensures that enqueuing and dequeuing operations can be done in constant time complexity O(1) regardless of the buffer size.

### `en_queue`

The `en_queue` method is responsible for adding elements to the rear of the buffer. If the buffer is not full, the new element is added at the tail position. If the buffer is full, the front element is overwritten, and the tail and head pointers are adjusted accordingly.

### `de_queue`

The `de_queue` method removes the front element from the buffer. If the buffer is empty, this method returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` after successfully dequeuing the element.

### `get_front` and `get_rear`

These methods return the value of the front and rear elements, respectively. If the buffer is empty, they return `-1`.

### `is_empty` and `is_full`

These methods check if the buffer is empty or full, respectively, and return `True` or `False`.

### `get_average`

This method calculates and returns the average of the elements in the buffer. If the buffer is empty, it returns `None`.

## Usage

1. Create a `RingBuffer` object with a specified maximum capacity.
2. Use the `en_queue` method to add elements to the buffer.
3. Use the `de_queue` method to remove the front element.
4. Utilize the other methods to retrieve information about the buffer's state and content.

## Conclusion

The `RingBuffer` implementation provides an efficient way to manage a fixed-size buffer with circular behavior. It offers constant-time complexity for basic operations, making it suitable for applications where memory efficiency and a rotating data structure are required.
